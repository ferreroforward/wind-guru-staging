// Wind Guru — spot database for the Strait of Georgia / Howe Sound / Metro
// Vancouver region.
// Each spot encodes the local meteorology needed by rules.js to tell thermal
// wind apart from synoptic/gradient wind, and to flag onshore vs offshore
// direction risk.
//
// regime types a spot can exhibit:
//   "thermal"   — local heating-driven wind (sea breeze / valley inflow), needs sun + weak gradient
//   "outflow"   — cold-air drainage / gap wind down a valley, gradient-driven, any time of day
//   "synoptic"  — general Strait of Georgia gradient wind ahead of / behind a front
//
// favorable_deg: [start,end] compass sector(s) considered rideable / safe onshore-to-cross-shore.
// Directions outside this sector are flagged as "offshore / not rideable" even if speed matches.
//
// Coordinates for every spot are the actual water-access/launch point Guillermo
// uses, not necessarily the beach's official/park coordinates — confirmed
// directly by him (Aug 2026), see individual spot comments for anything more
// specific than that.
//
// A few spots also carry `tide_note`, `direction_note`, or `current_note`
// fields — documentation-only local knowledge that isn't wired into
// classifyHour() (this app doesn't track tide state or current at all yet —
// see README "Known limitations"). They're captured here so a rider can
// apply them manually and so the config is a complete record of what's
// known, not just what the rule engine currently uses.

Per local rider knowledge (Michael Thomas, North Shore Wing Group): the last hour or two of falling tide before slack, still with a west wind, produces a notably good rip. Not modeled (this app doesn't track tide state yet); factor in manually against a tide table.",
    direction_note: "The more west in the wind, the better — a wind with a lot of north in it works less well. Almost identical to Dundarave Pier Beach nearby; on a given day one spot can work better than the other."
